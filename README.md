# UFOs
# Project Overview
Dana tasked us with helping her build a website that takes the records of reported UFO sitings. This website allows you to filter by city, state, country and shape of the UFO to help identify what we are looking at in the database.

# Results

By specifying either of the options in the filter category and pressing enter. The website will update and provide the information with the filter applied. I tried to make the website easy to use and understand for ease of use.
# Summary
My main concern with this webiste is that there hasn't been fact checking done to my knowledge. I would reccomend an Ai that can identify if a photo has been altered or changed. Another beneificial thing this site could use is a link to sources or something along those lines.
